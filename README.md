# Binary Bot

Visual automation for binary bot- [bot.binary.com](https://bot.binary.com)

Binary Bot uses [Google Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) to provide a puzzle like automation environment to trade using binary.com API version 3.

## Pre-installation

Ensure that your environment contains the following packages.

```
 - node
 - npm
 - git (for contribution)
```

## Installation

### 1. Setup the project on local machine

In order to work with Binary-Bot application, you must create your own version of this project. Please fork the project - https://github.com/binary-com/binary-bot to your git account.

You will need to perform the following on your development machine:

1. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
2. Clone the forked repo using `git clone [URL for the forked repo]`
3. Run `cd binary-bot`
4. Create a feature branch from master - `git checkout -b [branchName]`.
5. Run `npm install`

   > **Note:** - [issue with installing packages](#q1)

### 2. Configuring Hosts file

In order to run our application for the first time, you need to configure your hosts file:

If you are using a UNIX based system (Mac or Linux), Do the following:

1. Open terminal.
2. Open hosts file in your preferred text editor using `sudo vim /etc/hosts`.
3. Add a new entry pointing to `127.0.0.1 localbot.binary.sx`
4. Save the file

For Windows:

1.  Run Microsoft Notepad as an administrator.

2.  From Notepad, open the file: `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`

3.  Add a new entry pointing to `127.0.0.1 localbot.binary.sx`

4.  Save the file

### 3. Preparing environment variables

If you want to use _Google Drive features_ in the project (**to Save/Load strategies**)
you need to create a file called `.env` at the project root with the following content:

```
GD_CLIENT_ID=GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID
GD_API_KEY=GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_KEY
GD_APP_ID=GOOGLE_DRIVE_APP_ID
```

Here comes useful links for more information on how to confgure your project
with Google Drive integration:

- [Enabling the Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/enable-drive-api)
- [Creating API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
- [Generating Client ID](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid)

### 4. Starting a Development Server

Make sure to set the endpoint for running the application on the localhost

1. Run `npm start` on the binarybot directory. This will open the application in your default browser.

   > **Note:** - [Getting Permission Denied Error](#q2)

2. Now we have to set the endpoint for running the application on the localhost.
   For this, Go to `http://localbot.binary.sx/endpoint.html`. Make sure the Server is set to `blue.binaryws.com` and O Auth App ID is `16014`
   Click submit.

3. Navigate to `http://localbot.binary.sx/bot.html` (Note that the protocol is `http` and not `https`)

   > **Note:** - [Getting error "This site canâ€™t be reached" on localhost](#q3)

4. And now you are ready with your setup.Login to the binary account using the Binary.com account credentials. Run the bot

## Pushing changes to github

1. Make your changes to the source code
2. Run test command to make sure your changes are correct
   `npm run test`
3. Push your changes to your forked repo:

```
git add .
git commit -m "describe your changes"
git push origin BRANCH_NAME
```

## Deploying to local gh-pages

You can set up your GitHub Pages to deploy your repository.

1. First you need to set up custom domain. Go to `https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/binary-bot/settings/pages` and set your custom domain to `YOUR_GITHUB_NAME.binary.sx`

2. Add a new env variable `PROJECT_NAME` and the value should be the project name of your forked repository. The default value of this parameter will be `binary-bot`.

```
PROJECT_NAME=[project name]
```

3.  Run the command below in your project directory.

```
npm run release --branch [branchname] # can contain /
```

4. Now, your repository can be found at `https://YOUR_CUSTOM_DOMAIN/BRANCH_NAME`

## Deployment/Release

```
gulp test-deploy # for local test deploy
npm run release --branch <branch-name> # to deploy a branch (eg., beta)
npm run release-production # to release it to production
```

## To update to latest version

```
git pull --rebase upstream master
npm install
```

## Running the CLI command

```
npm i -g binary-bot
bot -h // For a quick help
bot bot-example.js
```

### Running with a specific endpoint **Use only if you know what you're doing**

```
ENDPOINT='wss://ws.binaryws.com/websockets/v3?l=en&app_id=1169' bot bot-example.js
```

### CLI examples:

[`speed-test.js`](https://github.com/binary-com/binary-bot/blob/master/cli-examples/speed-test.js)

## Hide Deriv/Binary Branding (Logos and Deriv/Binary Mentions)

## FAQ

### <a name='q1'> 1. Issue with installing packages</a>

If you couldnt install binary bot with a different node version, try cleaning npm cache.

- To clear a cache in npm, we need to run the `npm cache clean --force` command in our terminal.
- Delete cache directory. The default cache directory is ~/.npm on Posix (mac or linux), or %AppData%/npm-cache on Windows.
- Run `rm -rf ~/.npm`
- Run `npm install`

### <a name='q2'> 2. Getting Permission Denied Error on localhost</a>

Try `sudo npm start`instead of `npm start`
